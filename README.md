# GoogleGemini

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.9.

## Purpose
This project was created as a proof of concept to use Angular with [Google's Gemini AI](https://gemini.google.com).
If you use this project, you will have to provide your own Gemini API key.  You can get one at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).
More information on Google Gemini can be found [here](https://gemini.google.com).  Information on building with Google Gemini with Google AI Studio or Vertex AI can be found [here](https://ai.google.dev/).


The application will prompt you to give your API key.  It will then store it in localstorage, so you do not have to enter it all the time.  There is an option to remove your key for security purposes.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
